**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to TunedIn.space!**

Your new favorite place to overshare your music taste. (We won't judge. Much.)

### Getting Started

- Scroll the feed and eavesdrop on what everyone else is jamming to.
- Smash **[ login / register ]** to join the party and drop your own bangers.
- Share links from YouTube, Spotify, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, or even that obscure .mp3 you found at 3am.
- Tag your posts (#vibes, #throwback, #2020) so fellow music nerds can find them.
- Hit **[ play all ]** to turn the feed into your personal radio station.


### How to Post

- Give us a title, an artist, and a legit music link. (No Rickrolls. Or... maybe just one.)
- Tags = discoverability. Donâ€™t be shy.
- Optional: Tell us why this track slaps. Or just type "banger." We get it.
- **You can post once every 24 hours. Plan your pick and come back tomorrow to share again!**

### Listening & Queue

- Player controls up top: play, skip, shuffle, clear. DJ skills not required.
- The queue is just the current feed, so filter and sort to your heartâ€™s content.

### Personalize

- Pick an accent color. Express yourself. (Sorry, no glitter... yet.)

### Tips & Tricks

- Click tags to filter the feed. Use [ clear tag ] to see everything again.
- Everything is keyboard accessible, so you can flex your shortcut skills.
- Be kind, have fun, and remember: one personâ€™s guilty pleasure is anotherâ€™s anthem.



# TunedIn.space â€” Minimal Music Threads Webapp

**TunedIn.space** is a modern, minimal web app for sharing and discussing music. Features include user authentication, music threads with tags, likes, comments, and a built-in playlist/queue. The app rocks a "monospace vibes" look and supports two modes:
- **Local mode:** All data is stored in the browser's LocalStorage.
- **Supabase mode:** Data is synced with a Supabase backend (cloud database).
